**If your issue is related with an error or unexpected behavior please fill in a [BUG] report instead.**

**Describe the functionality you would like to see included into the app**
Give a detailed explanation of the desired functionality and an actual use case.
Please provide external references if possible.

**Please detail any side effects or problems that you believe may arise from implementing the functionality you request**
This will give developers and users a more accurate idea of the positive and negative consequences of the proposed modification.

**Finally, include a link If you have already implemented the desired functionality in a fork.**

**Additional remarks**
wthr is a minimal command line application, it is built to do one thing and one thing only. 
My focus will always be on improving the source code, minimizing bugs and increasing performance over adding new features.
